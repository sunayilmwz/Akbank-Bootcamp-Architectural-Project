# Akbank Deep Learning Bootcamp: Architectural Heritage Classification

## 1. Project Goal
The main goal of my project is to build a deep learning model that can classify images of different architectural elements, for example arches, columns, and domes. I will use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transfer Learning to get a high accuracy score. Another important part of the project is to understand why the model makes a certain prediction. For this, I will use visualization tools like Grad CAM to see which parts of an image are important for the model's decision.

## 2. Dataset
For this project, I am using the "Architectural Heritage Elements" dataset which is available on Kaggle. The dataset has about 15,000 images in 10 different classes. You can find the dataset at this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ikobzev/architectural-heritage-elements-image64-dataset

## 3. Methodology
The steps I will follow in this project are:

1.  **Data Preprocessing and Augmentation:** First, I will prepare the image data for training. I will also use data augmentation to create more training examples for the model, which should help it generalize better.
2.  **CNN and Transfer Learning:** I plan to build a simple CNN model from scratch first. After that, I will use a pretrained model with Transfer Learning to get a higher accuracy.
3.  **Model Evaluation:** I will evaluate my models using metrics like accuracy, a confusion matrix, and a classification report to see how well they perform.
4.  **Model Interpretation:** I will use Grad CAM to visualize what the model focuses on in an image. This helps to understand its decisions.
5.  **Hyperparameter Optimization:** Finally, I will experiment with different parameters like learning rate or batch size to find the best configuration for the model.

## 4. Results
(I will update this section with the final results, like the test accuracy of my best model, when the project is finished.)
